<h3>What we do</h3>

<h4>Python</h4>
<p>
  Python is a relatively new language, but it's become super popular with everything from building applications to machine learning! In this course we take a look at:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Variables</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
  <li>Object oriented programming</li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h4>NodeJS</h4>
<p>NodeJS is a variation of JavaScript that's used for programming servers, which allows for more security and data sharing between users! In the events, we created a bakery application that can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get all the bakery items (different kinds of cakes, pies, etc.) in the database</li>
  <li>Filter the list of items by item category and name</li>
  <li>Add custom items to the database</li>
  <li>Delete items from the database</li>
</ul>

<h4>Web design</h4>

  <p>Our latest and greatest events! We learn the basics of <b>HTML, CSS, and good web design techniques</b> through example projects.</p>
